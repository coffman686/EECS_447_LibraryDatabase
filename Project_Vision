Vision Statement: The Library Management System (LMS) project will deliver an efficient, user-friendly, and secure database system to support
small library operations. The LMS will enable seamless management of loanable items (books, digital media, magazines), enforce borrowing rules 
based on diverse membership categories, and generate insightful reports. By integrating modern database design principles, the system will streamline 
item tracking, membership management, and financial oversight. Overall enhancing the library's service to clients.


Scope Statement: The Library Management System (LMS) project will design and implement a relational database for a small library to manage loanable
items, memberships, borrowing rules, and generate reports. It will model entities like books, digital media, magazines, and clients, and enforce
constraints like borrowing limits and fees based on membership type. The system will include features for managing loans, returns, and client
accounts, with user interfaces for both staff and clients. Advanced queries will generate financial and activity reports, while concurrency and
transaction management will ensure seamless multi-user operations. The LMS will be developed through domain modeling, database design, and
implementation phases, ensuring functionality and data integrity.
