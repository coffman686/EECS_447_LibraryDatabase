Vision statement: We are developing this library database to make managing and accessing library resources more efficient. The goal is to create a system that helps staff and users easily 
find and borrow books, journals, and other materials. By automating tasks like tracking inventory and organizing resources, we can reduce errors and save time. Ultimately, 
this database will support learning and research by making the library run more smoothly and improving the overall experience for users.

Scope statement. Define the scope of the project, indicating what will be completed.

Team organization and profiles. Define the team organization and team member profiles. Assign roles for the team members, and designate one member as the team administrator. Team member profiles should include: names, contact information, availability, computing platform experience, and programming language knowledge. Adding photos is recommended for future reference.

Weekly meetings. Decide on weekly meeting details: Provide the location, schedule, and methods for task allocation and tracking.
